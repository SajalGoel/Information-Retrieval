Assigned Search Engine: Bing

Average Percent Overlap: 32.7%
Average Spearman Coefficient: -6.0781

The performance of Bing is fairly poor when compared to Google. This is evident from the values of average percent overlap and the 
spearman coefficient. The query results from Bing overlapped Google search query results only 32.7% times which indicates that Bing 
is infact using a different algorithm for weighting and ranking the documents. A negative spearman coefficient value indicates that 
the overlapping results are uncorrelated.
